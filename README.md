# npm-strap

Until I build a tool for automating the creation of the scripts in package.json,
there are some assumptions:

- the code base is in source/
- the library code is in lib/
- the build directory is build/
- we want to use jspm
- the javascript is in source/app.js
- the html is in source/index.html
- the css is in source/style.css
